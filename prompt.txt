These tables provide:

HIPAA-compliant structure with proper RLS policies
Vector search capabilities for RAG functionality
Flexible JSON storage for complex health data
Comprehensive indexing for optimal performance
Audit trails with created_at timestamps
Proper foreign key relationships and constraints
The RLS policies ensure that patients can only access their own data, and caretakers can only access data for patients they're authorized to view.

Next steps would be to:

Set up your Supabase project and configure the database tables
Implement the authentication flow (login/signup pages)
Build out individual feature pages (vitals, medications, wellness logs)
Add the AI chat functionality with RAG integration
Implement voice logging and wearable integrations
Would you like me to help you with any specific component next?

Personal Engagement and Wellness App
I want to develop a Patient Engagement and Wellness App. This app will serve as a bridge between healthcare providers and both prospective and discharged patients by offering value-added features that foster long-term relationships, promote health literacy, and enable personalized care, while adhering to HIPAA security and privacy standards.

Objectives
-Attract new patients through a consumer-friendly, AI-powered mobile application.
-Maintain ongoing engagement with discharged patients to encourage return visits, follow-up care, and improved health outcomes.
-Enable secure storage and management of patient health information (PHI) including vital signs, medications, and general physician notes.
-Provide AI-assisted health coaching and physician recommendations via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system connected to a local or commercial LLM.
-Open additional revenue streams through targeted advertising, wellness partnerships, and white-labelling opportunities.

Key Features
-Patient-Centered Functions
-HIPAA-Compliant PHI Storage: Secure repository for vital signs, medications, and general health notes.
-Wellness Dashboard: Tracks health goals, medications, vitals, and exercise.
-AI Health Agent: Offers health tips, general guidance, and recommends physicians based on user preferences and health profiles using a RAG database.
-Wellness Features: Integration with fitness trackers, diet logs, mental health check-ins, and reminders for appointments or medications.
-Patient Onboarding & Reactivation: Allows storage of inactive or prospective patient data for future engagement.

AI & Data Integration
RAG-Enabled Vector Database: Collects structured and unstructured patient data to support intelligent AI interactions.
AI-Powered Recommendations: Suggests local physicians, wellness programs, and health resources.
Secure Local or Commercial LLM Integration: Ensures data remains within privacy constraints while leveraging advanced AI capabilities.

SW architecture

1. Frontend (Mobile/Web App)
Tech Stack: React Native (Android/iOS), React.js (Web)

Functions:
2FA Login & Signup (Supabase Authentication)
Dashboard: Vitals, Medications, Wellness Logs
AI Health Agent Chat
Notifications & Reminders
Onboarding Flows: Self-join or provider-invited

2. Backend (Supabase-Powered)
Supabase: PostgreSQL (DB), Authentication, Storage, Realtime

Functions:
User management, 2FA, and session handling
API for PHI storage and retrieval
Vector database using pgvector for RAG
Storage buckets for user files (e.g., physician notes, wearable data)

3. AI & RAG Layer
Vector Database: pgvector (built into Supabase)
LLM Integration: Local or Commercial (e.g., OpenAI, Mistral)
RAG Pipeline: Retrieve wellness articles, patient history, or previous interactions
Voice-to-Text Phase: ElevenLabs, Whisper API, or Android/iOS native speech services

4. Logging Phases for Medications, Vitals, and Wellness
Phase	Input Method	Tools
Phase 1	Manual Text Entry	Mobile UI Forms
Phase 2	Voice Logging	ElevenLabs API, Whisper, or similar
Phase 3	Wearable Integration	Fitbit API, Apple Health, Google Fit
